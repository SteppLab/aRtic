# aRtic

**Version:** 0.1.0 (Beta)

This package provides core functionality for preprocessing articulatory kinematic data from EMA systems. It is currently in beta, designed to support primary use cases with limited functionality.

Further enhancements and expanded features are planned based on user feedback. Ideal for users comfortable with scripting with R. A Shiny app may be developed in the future.

## Installation

```{r, eval = F}

install.packages("remotes") # if you do not have remotes installed
remotes::install_github("StreppLab/aRtic")

```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the package:

```{r, eval = F}

library(aRtic)

# Load Data
bite_plane_data <- load_tsv("your_file_path")
sensor_data <- load_tsv("your_file_path")
palate_trace_data <- load_tsv("your_file_path")

# Define referent, bite plane, and palate trace sensor idicies
## The current version of this package requires 3 referent sensors (two behind the left and right mastoids, one on the incisor)

ref_idx <- c(1, 2, 3)
bp_idx <- c(5, 6, 7)
pl_idx <- 8

# Defining the coordinate plane from the bite plane recording
coord <- define_coord(bite_plane_data[[1]], ref_idx, bp_idx)

# Interpolation and filtering of sensor data recording
filtered <- interp_filter(sensor_data[[1]], ref_idx)

# Rotate and correct sensor recording for head movement
corrected <- correct_mov(filtered, coord[[1]], ref_idx, coord[[2]], coord[[3]])

# Estimate palate location (optional)
## Filtering and rotation steps are built into this function

palate <- est_palate(palate_trace_data[[1]], coord[[1]], ref_idx, pl_idx, coord[[2]], coord[[3]])

```
